# UNICENi Compiler

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the "UNICENi" language Compiler, a custom-built compiler for the "UNICENi" programming language. This project was developed as part of the Compilers assignment at UNICEN. "UNICENi" is an invented programming language designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in compiler design and implementation using Java.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parses tokens to ensure they follow Uniceni's grammar.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Validates the semantic correctness of the parsed code.
- **Code Generation**: Transforms valid source code into executable format.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting for easier debugging.
